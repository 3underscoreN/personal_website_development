# 3_n's personal website

## Introduction

My personal website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://3underscoreN.github.io). This repo is the development repo for the website.

## Structure

- The contents of the "paragraphs", as well as the resume, is stored in `lib/src/text`.
- Theme files are stored under `lib/src/theme`.
- Provider for theme state (that fetches theme status from `sharedPreferences` instance) are under `lib/src/provider`.
- The code for widgets are stored under `lib/src/components.`

- `web` is generated by Flutter and will be used for compiling.

## Compile

In the root folder, run
```bash
$ flutter build web
```
A new folder `build/web` will be made and contains compiled data.

## Testing

I'm too lazy to write test though I know its importance `orz`
It would be greatly appreciated if you know how to write test cases!!

## Contribution

Opening PRs and Issues are welcomed.
